This self-hosting guide will walk you through the steps to self-host Infisical using Docker Compose.


<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Docker Compose">
    ## Prerequisites
    - [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
    - [Docker compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

    <Warning>
      This Docker Compose configuration is not designed for high-availability production scenarios. 
      It includes just the essential components needed to set up an Infisical proof of concept (POC). 
      To run Infisical in a highly available manner, give the [Docker Swarm guide](/self-hosting/deployment-options/docker-swarm).
    </Warning>

    ## Verify prerequisites
    To verify that Docker compose and Docker are installed on the machine where you plan to install Infisical, run the following commands.

    Check for docker installation
    ```bash
    docker
    ```

    Check for docker compose installation
    ```bash
    docker-compose 
    ```

    ## Download docker compose file
    You can obtain the Infisical docker compose file by using a command-line downloader such as `wget` or `curl`.
    If your system doesn't have either of these, you can use a equivalent command that works with your machine.

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="curl">
        ```bash
        curl -o docker-compose.prod.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Infisical/infisical/main/docker-compose.prod.yml
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="wget">
        ```bash 
        wget -O docker-compose.prod.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Infisical/infisical/main/docker-compose.prod.yml
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    ## Configure instance credentials
    Infisical requires a set of credentials used for connecting to dependent services such as Postgres, Redis, etc.
    The default credentials can be downloaded using the one of the commands listed below. 

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="curl">
        ```bash
          curl -o .env https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Infisical/infisical/main/.env.example
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="wget">
        ```bash 
          wget -O .env https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Infisical/infisical/main/.env.example
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    Once downloaded, the credentials file will be saved to your working directly as `.env` file.
    View all available configurations [here](/self-hosting/configuration/envars).

    <Warning>
      The default .env file contains credentials that are intended solely for testing purposes.
      Please generate a new `ENCRYPTION_KEY` and `AUTH_SECRET` for use outside of testing. 
      Instructions to do so, can be found [here](/self-hosting/configuration/envars).
    </Warning>

    ## Start Infisical
    Run the command below to start Infisical and all related services. 

    ```bash
    docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up
    ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Podman Compose">
  Podman Compose is an alternative way to run Infisical using Podman as a replacement for Docker. Podman is backwards compatible with Docker Compose files.

      ## Prerequisites
    - [Podman](https://podman-desktop.io/docs/installation)
    - [Podman Compose](https://podman-desktop.io/docs/compose)

    <Warning>
      This Docker Compose configuration is not designed for high-availability production scenarios. 
      It includes just the essential components needed to set up an Infisical proof of concept (POC). 
      To run Infisical in a highly available manner, give the [Docker Swarm guide](/self-hosting/deployment-options/docker-swarm).
    </Warning>


    ## Verify prerequisites
    To verify that Podman compose and Podman are installed on the machine where you plan to install Infisical, run the following commands.

    Check for podman installation
    ```bash
    podman version 
    ```

    Check for podman compose installation
    ```bash
    podman-compose version
    ```

    ## Download Docker Compose file
    You can obtain the Infisical docker compose file by using a command-line downloader such as `wget` or `curl`.
    If your system doesn't have either of these, you can use a equivalent command that works with your machine.

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="curl">
        ```bash
        curl -o docker-compose.prod.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Infisical/infisical/main/docker-compose.prod.yml
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="wget">
        ```bash 
        wget -O docker-compose.prod.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Infisical/infisical/main/docker-compose.prod.yml
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    ## Configure instance credentials
    Infisical requires a set of credentials used for connecting to dependent services such as Postgres, Redis, etc.
    The default credentials can be downloaded using the one of the commands listed below. 

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="curl">
        ```bash
          curl -o .env https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Infisical/infisical/main/.env.example
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="wget">
        ```bash 
          wget -O .env https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Infisical/infisical/main/.env.example
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    <Note>
      Make sure to rename the `.env.example` file to `.env` before starting Infisical. Additionally it's important that the `.env` file is in the same directory as the `docker-compose.prod.yml` file.
    </Note>

    ## Setup Podman
    Run the commands below to setup Podman for first time use.
    ```bash
    podman machine init --now
    podman machine set --rootful
    podman machine start
    ``` 

    <Note>
      If you are using a rootless podman installation, you can skip the `podman machine set --rootful` command.
    </Note>

    ## Start Infisical
    Run the command below to start Infisical and all related services. 

    ```bash
    podman-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>




Your Infisical instance should now be running on port `80`. To access your instance, visit `http://localhost:80`.
