You can have Infisical automatically sync group
memberships between your OIDC provider and Infisical by configuring a `groups` claim on your provider tokens.
When a user logs in via OIDC, they will be added to Infisical groups that are present in their OIDC `groups` claim,
and removed from any Infisical groups not present in the claim.

<Info>
    When enabled, manual
    management of Infisical group memberships will be disabled.
</Info>

<Warning>
    Group membership changes in your OIDC provider only sync with Infisical when a
    user logs in via OIDC. For example, if you remove a user from a group in your OIDC provider,
    this change will not be reflected in Infisical until their next OIDC login.
    To ensure this behavior, Infisical recommends enabling Enforce OIDC SSO in the OIDC settings.
</Warning>


<Steps>
    <Step title="Configure a groups claim in your OIDC provider">
       To enable OIDC Group Membership Mapping, you must configure a `groups` claim in your OIDC provider.

        Add a `groups` property with a list of the user's OIDC group names to your token.

        Example of expected token payload:
        ```json
        {
            // "email": "john@provider.com",
            // "given_name": "John",
            // ...other claims
            "groups": ["Billing Group", "Sales Group"]
        }
        ```

        <Note>
            Setup varies between OIDC providers. Please refer to your OIDC provider's documentation for more information.
        </Note>

    <Step title="Setup groups in Infisical and enable OIDC Group Membership Mapping">
        2.1. In Infisical, create any groups you would like to sync users to. Make sure the name of the Infisical group is an exact match of the OIDC group name.
